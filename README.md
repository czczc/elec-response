# Response Visualizer

This project is a React application for visualizing responses.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
*   You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm).

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the application in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`. The server will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command bundles the app into static files for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory. This build is optimized for performance and ready to be deployed.
